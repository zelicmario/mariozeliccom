        <p>
         I am a structural geologist working at the intersection of geoscience, engineering, data science, and mining. I hold a PhD from the University of Pisa, Italy, and have nearly two decades of experience spanning academia, consulting, corporate environments, mineral exploration, and mine operations.
		 </p>
		 
		<p>
		My work focuses on understanding structural architecture and mineralisation through integrated, multi-scale approaches that support orebody understanding, geological risk management, and informed technical and operational decision-making. I have held senior technical, advisory and leadership roles across research and industry and have published extensively in research and conference settings. I value disciplined collaboration and multidisciplinary integration as core enablers of safe, effective, and value-driven exploration and mining.
